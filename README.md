2. **Menu Toggle Button**: A button that toggles the menu.

### Code Example: Basic Setup
Here is the TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { MenuController } from '@ionic/angular';

constructor(private menu: MenuController) {}

openCustom() {
    this.menu.enable(true, 'custom');
    this.menu.open('custom');
}

close() {
    this.menu.close();
}

toggle() {
    this.menu.toggle();
}
```

The corresponding HTML:

```html
<ion-menu side="start" menuId="custom">
  <ion-header>
    <ion-toolbar>
      <ion-title>Custom Menu</ion-title>
    </ion-toolbar>
  </ion-header>
  <ion-content>
    <ion-list>
      <ion-item (click)="close()">
        <ion-icon name="close" slot="start"></ion-icon>
        Close
      </ion-item>
      <ion-item (click)="toggle()">
        <ion-icon name="menu" slot="start"></ion-icon>
        Toggle Menu
      </ion-item>
    </ion-list>
  </ion-content>
</ion-menu>
```
Ensure that the routes and page navigation are set up correctly to ensure a seamless user experience.

To Distinguish the top navigation menu and the Side-menu, just put the top navigation menu items in `ion-header`. This is the bare minimum requaired.

Here is the example

```typescript
export class HomePage {
  constructor(public menu: MenuController){}
  ionViewWillEnter(){
    this.menu.enable(true, 'first');
  }
}

```

## 15. What is _virtual scrolling_ and when would you use it in _Ionic_?

**Virtual Scrolling** is a performance optimization technique in **Ionic** that's especially useful for long, dynamically changing lists.

### Core Mechanism

- **Window Sizing**: Instead of displaying the entire list, the viewport is divided into segments of a defined size. Items in these segments are loaded and viewed by the user.
- **Dynamic Loading**: As the user scrolls, new items are loaded into the viewport while the ones out of view are unloaded, thereby maintaining a finite, manageable size.

### Use Cases

1. **Long Lists**: For user interfaces with extended lists, such as chat logs or news feeds.
2. **Performance Optimization**: This is especially important for lower-end devices, where loading and rendering numerous items can cause lags or crashes.
3. **Dynamic Lists**: When the list is expected to change frequently, like in an e-commerce app where new items are added continually.

### Code Example: Rendering a Virtually Scrolling List in Ionic with **VirtualScroll**
The Ionic list component, **ion-virtual-scroll**, provides an interface to render lists using virtual scrolling.

Here is the Ionic HTML code:

```html
<ion-content>
  <ion-list [virtualScroll]="dynamicList">
    <ion-item *virtualItem="let item">{{ item }}</ion-item>
  </ion-list>
</ion-content>
```

In TypeScript, the corresponding list data can be provided:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'virtual-scroll-example',
  templateUrl: 'virtual-scroll-example.html',
  styleUrls: ['virtual-scroll-example.scss']
})
export class VirtualScrollExample {

  dynamicList: any[] = [];

  constructor() {
    // Assuming this method triggers list changes dynamically
    this.updateDynamicList();
  }

  updateDynamicList() {
    // Logic to update dynamicList
  }
}
```

Ensure that the **ion-virtual-scroll** element has its parent container set to a specific height and is a direct child of **ion-content** or a non-scrolling container for proper operation.
